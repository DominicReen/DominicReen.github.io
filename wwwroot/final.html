  <p>1.	Topic / Background / Introduction<br>
This website is Whole Earth Nursery & Garden Center. This is a general information, billboard type website intended to be user-friendly for current and potential customers who may have minimal online experience.  The main goal of the website is to increase public awareness of the nursery’s goods and services; the subsequent, secondary goal is to increase in-person visits to the nursery and ultimately increase sales. The target audience at present includes homeowners in central Indiana, particularly those in the 35+ age range. 

<p>2.	Problem Exploration<br>
The value of the website to this business will be evaluated through monitoring of changes in the number of customer calls and in-store visits, the number of online contacts, and changes in overall sales. At present, the website includes 15 accessible content pages, plus additional requirements for the assignment. The presentation level is simple, including only one use of multimedia, and requiring little bandwidth. Future development will focus on increased complexity such as interactivity for online purchasing and mobile-friendly design. 
<p>3.	Requirements Analysis and Specification<br>
The current goals necessitate only brochure-ware, but next-step development is anticipated to include a database of customer information, with eventual implantation of online purchasing. There are no elaborate hardware or software needs in the present iteration.  
<p>4.	Information Architecture, Organization, and Design<br>
There are four first-level pages, determined by the general product categories of flowers, trees, shrubs, and tools and supplies. These levels are broken down into a page for each subcategory including annual and perennial flowers; flowering and evergreen shrubs; tools and supplies; flowering, fruit, ornamental, and evergreen trees. 
<p>5.	Testing, Maintenance, and Promotion Plan<br>
We hope to secure a contract with Whole Earth to provide periodic updates and needed maintenance, and will suggest advertising such as online promo codes, and targeted marketing through social media, as well as submission to Google.
<p>6.	Implementation and Reflection<br>
The main challenges were understanding and being able to apply information from the text. Several w3schools.com tutorials were used. This has been one of the most challenging assignments, but I do realize that I learned a tremendous amount by applying the text concepts in a different setting. The biggest challenge was integration of javascript, which really had only a passable, rather than excellent, outcome. Anticipated changes include development of interactivity and mobile-friendly uses.
