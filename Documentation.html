	  1.  Topic/Background/Introduction
	  </h2>
	  <p class="maintext">
		The name of this website is “Reen Cinematography and VFX”, and the purpose of it is to sell the services of our company by explaining why we should be hired. This website also gives examples of what we can do.  You might ask; “Why does this web site exist?”, and the answer is, that without this website, our company might not be as well-known as we should be.  For some crazy reason, the editors of all the movies we have worked on have forgotten to add us to the credits.  The target audience of this website is mainly movie directors who are searching for cinematographers and VFX artists to work on their film.  That is why we don’t explain exactly what a VFX artist and a cinematographer is.
		For those of you who are wondering, VFX stands for “Visual Effects”, which are any effects that are added to the video on a computer, (not to be confused with Special Effects, which are on-set “real-life” explosions, fire, smoke, etc.), and a cinematographer is the person in charge of the camera.  He may not actually be the one holding/moving the camera, but he is in charge of the people that are.

		2. Problem Exploration
	  </h2>
	  <p class="maintext">
			I am my own client, so the first question is not applicable.
			I would consider the site successful if we got hired from the website, and/or if we got more appreciation for our work.  We are well known in the movie business, but the average citizen most likely hasn’t even heard of us.
			This site probably won’t take up much bandwidth, because there are only a few videos on it.  Videos take up a lot of bandwidth, but probably not as much as an interactive game or something similar would.
			There are 16 pages on the website, with three levels.  The pages are not very complex, because we are going for a more minimal look.  There is a quite complicated use of Javascript for a slideshow, and a few videos.
			I may add more videos and pictures to the gallery section of the website, so that will be changed in the future.
			This site is best accessed on a computer, but I will add mobile support soon.

			The Ivy Tech student server will be hosting the website, and I will be maintaining it.
			This website is basically Brochure-ware.

		<h2>
			4.  Information Architecture, Organization, and Design
		</h2>
		<p class="maintext">
			This site is meant to explain what our business is, give examples of our product, and provide a way of contacting and hiring us.
			The pages are connected by a navigation bar across the top of the pages.
			My family tried out my website, and really liked it.  My dad said he like how the text for each bio link was bigger for the page you are on.
			I will update this website, but after this course I will probably only use it to show off to friends, so it might get a bit outdated.
			I won’t advertise this website, because it will gain the traffic I want just by its name and content.
			I will cater to the google search engine, because it is the most commonly used one.

		<h2>
			6. Implementation and Reflection
		</h2>
		<p class="maintext">
			It was hard to think of 15 pages, but other than that, It’s not that hard to fulfill the project requirements.
			It was pretty hard to put the Javascript slideshow into my website.  For some reason, it wanted to be on the top left of my screen for the transition, but then the picture would cut to where it should go, but only display a slice of the top of the picture.  Basically it was glitchy.
			I will probably only change the bio and videos pages, to add future videos and update our ages.
